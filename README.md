# Image-Watermarking-Matlab
## The main goal of the project is to check the robustness of the spatial watermarking scheme.

To describe the procedure briefly:

->First select both the main content and watermarking image

->Than convert the watermark image to binary image since we hide it in 1 bitplane

->select the bitplane

->embedded the hidden image

->to check robustness attack the image with noise and apply various functions

->recover the embedded image

->show the results for visual comparison

->compare the psnr and snr of the original hidden image and recovered the hidden image
