# Image-Watermarking-Matlab
## The main goal of the project is to check the robustness of the spatial bit manipulation watermarking scheme.

To describe the procedure briefly:

->First select both the main content and watermarking image

->Than convert the watermark image to binary image since we hide it in 1 bitplane

->select the bitplane

->embedded the hidden image

->to check robustness attack the image with noise and apply various functions

->recover the embedded image

->show the results for visual comparison

->compare the psnr and snr of the original hidden image and recovered the hidden image.

The rest of the material can be found in the final report.
To run the program download all the files and keep it in one folder and then run the main.m file.
There is an image folder containing the results and various black and white images to test on.
