# Image-Watermarking-matlab
## The main goal of the project is to check the robustness of the spatial watermarking scheme.

###To describe the procedure briefly:
->First select both the main content and water marking image
->Than convert the watermark image to binary image since we hide it in 1 bitplane
->select the bitplane
->embedded the hidden image
->to check robusteness attack the image with noise and apply various functions
->recover the embedded image
->show the results
->compare the psnr and snr of the original hidden image and recovered hidden image
